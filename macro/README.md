# softcore-asm-macro

A proc macro to translate Rust's inline assembly into a pure Rust using the [softcore-rs](github.com/CharlyCst/softcore-rs) CPU model.

This crate is not intended for direct use, instead import [`softcore-asm-rv64`](https://crates.io/crates/softcore-asm-rv64) which re-exposes this macro.
